"""Download OBSERVED 10 m wind during Sandy, to verify a gridded wind source.

WHY (2026-08-03). The bay under-fills and the leading suspect is the wind forcing. Before
spending a 3 h solve on a wind arm, the hypothesis has to be testable against
observations — and this repo had NO observed wind at all. (Ironically
``download_ndbc_sandy_waves.py`` has parsed ``WDIR``/``WSPD``/``GST`` all along and then
dropped them at its ``["WVHT","DPD","MWD"]`` slice. The observation was one line away.)

WHAT IT ESTABLISHED. ERA5's wind MAGNITUDE over open water during Sandy is right — within
a few percent of three independent buoys. So "ERA5 is too weak" is FALSE as a blanket
statement. The defect is narrower and worse: ERA5's 10 m wind is a DIAGNOSTIC computed
from the surface-layer profile using ERA5's own LOCAL roughness, and the 0.25 deg cells
covering 4-6 km-wide Barnegat Bay are LAND cells. SFINCS then applies a marine drag law
to a forest-diagnosed wind.

⚠️ THE HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT IS AN ASSUMPTION, AND IT IS WORTH ~7%.
Buoy anemometers are not at 10 m. Each station's height is declared in ``STATIONS`` below
and the neutral log law ``U10 = U_z * ln(10/z0) / ln(z/z0)`` (z0 = 2e-4 m, open ocean) is
applied. BOTH the raw and the adjusted series are written, plus the assumed height, so a
later reader can undo or revise it. Do not quote a ratio without saying which one it is.

⚠️ NOAA 8534720 (Atlantic City) HAS NO WIND PRODUCT for 2012 — verified, do not add it.
