"""Score the Manahawkin BRACKET — the width, not the arm.

⚠️ THE ARM BEING SCORED HERE IS DELIBERATELY INADMISSIBLE. It leaves hydromt's
water-level boundary standing across the Manahawkin bay cross-section, imposing the
open-ocean level on INTERIOR bay water. That is the SAME defect class as the inlet
clamp, which scored well and cost the 2026-07-26..29 campaign. Nothing this script
prints is a candidate result. The ONLY quantity it exists to produce is the **width**
between the walled control (lower bound — the 39.70 wall can only UNDER-supply the bay)
and the bracket (upper bound — an imposed ocean level can only OVER-supply it).

That width is the most the omitted southern connection (Little Egg / Beach Haven
inlets) could possibly be worth, and it costs one run instead of a ~1.4 M-face
southward mesh rebuild plus a re-baseline of every arm.

Guards, because labelling was already proven insufficient once:
  * the control must pass ``premier.assert_sealed_domain`` (it IS a candidate);
  * the bracket must pass ``premier.assert_bracket`` — which additionally demands
    ``NJ_ALLOW_BRACKET=manahawkin-open``, so a copied command line cannot score one;
  * output goes to ``reports/bracket_manahawkin.csv``, NEVER ``reports/metrics.csv``,
    and every bracket row is stamped ``domain = BRACKET:<name> INADMISSIBLE``.

⚠️ The two arms differ by the mask ONLY, so the domain fingerprints differ ON PURPOSE
and pooling them is legitimate here for the same reason it is in
``score_interior_gauges.py``: the domain IS the treatment. Do not copy these rows into
a table beside HWM/CSI numbers.
